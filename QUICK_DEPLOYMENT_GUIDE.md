# üöÄ Quick Deployment Guide

## Problem Solved
Your ServiceNow External Portal was only working locally because the backend server was running on `localhost:3001`. Other devices couldn't access it, showing "Error Loading Services" and "Unable to connect to the API server".

## Solution Implemented
I've set up a complete deployment solution that will make your app accessible from any device:

### ‚úÖ What's Already Done
1. **Fixed category display issue** - Categories now show display names instead of sys_ids
2. **Updated backend server** - Added proper CORS handling and display value support
3. **Created deployment configuration** - Environment files and GitHub Actions setup
4. **Prepared server for cloud deployment** - Ready to deploy to Render.com, Railway, or Heroku
5. **Updated GitHub Actions** - Will automatically deploy frontend when backend URL is configured

### üìã What You Need to Do Next

#### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)
1. Run `setup-deployment.bat` in the project folder
2. Follow the prompts to create GitHub repository and deploy to Render.com
3. The script will guide you through each step

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. **Deploy Backend Server:**
   - Go to [Render.com](https://render.com) and sign up
   - Create new Web Service from GitHub
   - Connect the `server-repo` folder (you'll need to create a separate repository)
   - Add environment variables as shown in `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

2. **Update Frontend Configuration:**
   - Add your deployed server URL to GitHub Secrets
   - The GitHub Actions will automatically redeploy the frontend

3. **Test the Deployment:**
   - Visit your deployed backend: `https://your-server.onrender.com/health`
   - Visit your frontend: `https://HosenAgbaria.github.io/servicenow-external-portal-V3/`

### üîß Files Created/Updated
- `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete step-by-step guide
